# citra-nightly

Custom-built emulator optimized for Monster Hunter Double Cross
- **Fix lag:** Periodic slowdowns with frame drops
- **Port functions:** Touch-mapping, fix SaveStates hotkeys

Inspired by
- [Lurpigi/Lime3DS](https://github.com/Lurpigi/lime3ds-dqmj3p)
- [Slashaim/citra-dqmj3pro](https://github.com/Slashaim/citra-dqmj3pro)

**Important**

1. **Revert [Improve core timing accuracy (#5257)](https://github.com/Evilmass/citra-nightly/commit/57aa18f52ea35ca74cd1a6c406a4abf04049b44e)**
   - This commit introduced sudden frame rate drops to **56 FPS**
2. **Revert [Update FPS to roughly match the actual 3DS rate](https://github.com/Evilmass/citra-nightly/commit/5e95b35900bb8c840169c4446634ff67982aa842)**
   - This commit caused the frame rate to fluctuate between **58â€“60 FPS**
3. **Maintain `BASE_CLOCK_RATE_ARM11 = 268868160`**
   - Keeping this setting ensures the emulator runs at a **steady 60 FPS**

Citra is an experimental open-source Nintendo 3DS emulator/debugger written in C++. It is written with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows, Linux and macOS.

Citra emulates a subset of 3DS hardware and therefore is useful for running/debugging homebrew applications, and it is also able to run many commercial games! Some of these do not run at a playable state, but we are working every day to advance the project forward. (Playable here means compatibility of at least "Okay" on our [game compatibility list](https://citra-emu.org/game).)

Citra is licensed under the GPLv2 (or any later version). Refer to the license.txt file included. Please read the [FAQ](https://citra-emu.org/wiki/faq/) before getting started with the project.

### Development

Most of the development happens on GitHub. It's also where [our central repository](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra) is hosted.

If you want to contribute please take a look at the [Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/wiki/Contributing) and [Developer Information](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/wiki/Developer-Information). You should also contact any of the developers in the forum in order to know about the current state of the emulator because the [TODO list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SWIop0uBI9IW8VGg97TAtoT_CHNoP42FzYmvG1F4QDA) isn't maintained anymore.

If you want to contribute to the user interface translation, please check out the [citra project on transifex](https://www.transifex.com/citra/citra). We centralize the translation work there, and periodically upstream translations.

* Any equipment required for homebrew
* Infrastructure setup

We also more than gladly accept used 3DS consoles! If you would like to give yours away, don't hesitate to join our [Discord server](https://citra-emu.org/discord/) and talk to bunnei.
